# PwshBackupScript
A Powershell script to backup a directory. I mainly use this to backup my WoW Interface Folder, but you can use this for any directory, just change the variables in the script. It support multiple directories and can exclude folders. If the script finishes you get an Toast Notification :)

If you want to use compress the backups, make sure you have installed 7zip V16.00 or any later version of it.
